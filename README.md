## 🌟 This is Open Source Sovereignty

**We don't just teach freedom - we live it.** This entire sovereignty education platform is 100% open source because information wants to be free, and so do you.

Fork it. Share it. Build on it. Deploy your own sovereignty node. The code is yours - just like your sovereignty.

## 🔓 About LIBERTY

LIBERTY is the world's most comprehensive sovereignty education system—where ancient wisdom meets modern exit strategies. We provide the exact blueprints to reclaim your power across every domain of human existence, from your energy field to your economic reality, from your legal standing to your spiritual sovereignty.

This isn't philosophy. It's an operational manual for total system exit.

### 🎯 Why Open Source?

- **Transparency**: No hidden code, no backdoors, no surveillance
- **Resilience**: Can't be shut down when it's everywhere
- **Community**: Built by sovereigns, for sovereigns
- **Evolution**: Improves through collective wisdom
- **Sovereignty**: You own your tools of liberation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone your own sovereignty portal
git clone https://github.com/Traviseric/LIBERTY.git

# Enter the directory
cd LIBERTY

# Open in your editor
code .

# Serve locally (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or use any local server
npx serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and you're running your own sovereignty node!
